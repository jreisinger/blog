# Blog posts

Blog posts (wiki sites?) and other related data rendered on [blogspot](http://jreisinger.blogspot.sk).

If you reference some code or other files in you blog post store them to appropriate directory (`code` or `files`).

The blog posts are expected to be written in [MarkDown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and converted to HTML [like this](http://notely.blogspot.co.at/2011/08/how-to-use-markdown-in-blogspot-posts.html).
