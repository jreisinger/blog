[CPAN](https://metacpan.org/) is pretty huge and can be contributed to by virtually anyone. This means you might want to separate the wheat from the chaff. In order to do that these hints might help:

1. What's the code activity. The more the better.

2. How many bugs do we have. The open bugs show community involvement, the closed ones are about the maintainers dilligence.

3. The quality and quantity of tests and their results.

4. Reverse dependencies (they use the same basic principle as Google PageRank). The more the better.

5. Follow the advice of experts in the Perl field, ex. [Task::Kensho](https://metacpan.org/pod/Task::Kensho).

NOTE: don't evaluate any of them in isolation but all/more of them together.
