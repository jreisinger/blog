# Injecting modern concepts into legacy processes

1) Find pain points and build business case

* What problem really needs to be solved?
* Gather metrics showing how things can improve.
* Make business case showing why we need change and what we will get. 

2) Find allies, share and collaborate

* Ex. find people outside your team who can benefit from the change.

3) Start small and build from the bottom up

* Start with something easy to build confidence while working out issues.
* Ex. document => share documentation => automate (script) => automate more
