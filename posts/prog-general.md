Computer

* universal machine for information storage and manipulation
* can carry out any instructions described in sufficient detail (program)

Hardware (functional view)

* CPU - simple arithmetic (adding two numbers) and logical (testing two numbers
    are equal) operations
* Main memory - RAM (fast but volatile) -- stores information (data and programs) that CPU acts on
* Secondary memory (HD, CD, DVD) - stores more permanent information
* Input/Output devices - for entering/displaying information
* running a program: HD --> RAM --> CPU (fetch, decode, execute - with blazing
    speed!)

Computer science (CS)

* studies what can be computed
* uses techniques of design, analysis and experimentation
* computers are to CS what telescopes are to astronomy

Programming languages

* formal notation for writing programs
* have precise syntax (form) and semantics (meaning)
* machine language: low-level, created by the CPU designers, understood by computer hardware (in binary notation - sequences of 0s and 1s):

        load the number from memory location 2001 into the CPU
        load the number from memory location 2002 into the CPU
        add the two numbers in the CPU
        store the result into location 2003
* high-level language: human-oriented, must be compiled or interpreted, more portable
* compiled: faster
    * compiler - complex program that translates source code into machine code
* interpreted: more flexible (interactive) development
    * interpreter - a program that simulates a computer that understands a high-level language
* traditional systems languages (C++, Ada, Java): large-scale programming, emphasis on structure and discipline
* scripting ("agile") languages: designed for writing small/medium-scaled programs easy

(Python) program

* sequence of commands (statements) telling computer what to do
* statement = identifiers + expressions
* indentifiers - names, begin with an underscore or letter followed by letter,
    digit or underscore
* expressions - fragments of program that produce data
    * literals
    * variables
    * expressions

Programming

1. Problem analysis
2. Program specification (what to do)
3. Design (how to do it - algorithm)
4. Implementation (algorithm gets translated into programming language)
5. Testing and debugging
6. Maintenance (most programs are never finished)
