Variables

* types are associated with objects, not variables
* variables are not checked for type at compile time
* Python variables are more like labels that reference various objects
    (integers, strings, class instances, ...)

        x = "2"     # x is string
        x = int(x)  # x is now integer

* don't have to be declared
* can have any built-in data type, user-defined object, function, or module
    assigned to them

Synopsis

* built-in data types can be manipulated with operators, built-in functions,
    library functions, or a data type's own methods
* all Python objects are instances of one class or another

Built-in data types

* numbers
* lists

        []
        [1]
        [1, "two", (3, 4), ["a", "b"]]

 * built-in functions: len, max, min
 * operators: in, +, * (create new list, original unchanged)
 * statements: del
 * methods: append, count, extend, index, insert, pop, remove, reverse, sort

* tuples (immutable lists)
