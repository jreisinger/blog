Qualitative or quantitative facts about things. Information and then knowledge
are derived from data.

Binary data (in computer science) - data represented in binary form rather than
interpreted on higher level or converted to some other form. While most binary
data has symbolic meaning not all binary data is numeric (ex. computer instruc-
tions within processor registers). Computers rarely modify individual bits for
performance reasons. Instead, data is accessed in groups of 1 word (4 bytes) for
32-bit systems and 2 words for 64-bit systems.
