Exclusive or - the opposite of inlusive (the normal) or, which allows both 
possibilities as well as either:

    >>> True or True
    True
    >>> True or False
    True
    >>> False or True
    True
    >>> False or False
    False
    
Example of exlusive or in English: "You can have pizza or chicken" - you probably 
don't mean you can have both. Exclusive or expression in Python:

    >>> True != True
    False
    >>> True != False
    True
    >>> False != True
    True
    >>> False != False
    False
